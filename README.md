+ You might need to install [Jekyll] (http://jekyllrb.com) to view this site on your local machine :neutral_face:.

### Follow these steps:
+ Clone this repo
+ Install Jekyll. Launch the ruby terminal and fire `gem install jekyll`
+ Navigate to the project directory on the command line and run `jekyll serve`

Everything should work fine after that.
